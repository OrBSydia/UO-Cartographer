## MapCreator-Development - `Official Release` <div align="Right">Last Updated: 08/16/2023</div>

>**What Is MapCreator?!**

-   MapCreator is an open-source [Ultima Online](http://www.uo.com/)â„¢ map (facet) editor that was created for use with [Adobeâ„¢ Photoshop]([http://www.uo.com/](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html))
-   This powerful program can compile any world you create utilizing an encoded set of bitmaps and an Adobeâ„¢ Photoshop Swatch (.ACO), Optimized Color (.ACT), and customized Brush (.ABR) file
-   There are two versions available so choose wisely: one uses Ultima Online's out-of-the-box game files (any version), and the other uses uoAvocation's customized Ultima Online's game files and is capable of dual-layering maps during the compile process
   
>**What Is The Backstory!**

- MapCreator is the result of reverse-engineering UOLandscaper, and yes I did get permission to do that from UOLandscaper's creator Dknight. What separates the two programs is that MapCreator is coded in C# and UOLandscaper is coded in VisualBasic. Additionally MapCreator is open-source and can be modified whereas UOLandscaper is an old soul and closed-source.
- Dknight would not let me re-release UOLandscaper as an open-sourced project: so he told me to rebrand it, and then gave me permission to distribute it under the name MapCreator.
- So if you are wondering, yes both software use indentical compiler engines and 80% of the same code; MapCreator is more of a hybrid of C# and VisualBasic so the code is probably 80% the same as well.

## MapCreator User Features (At-A-Glance)

<img src="http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png" width="24" height="24">**The MapCreator Compiler**
- Create your facet indexed bitmap terrain file, sync that terrain bitmap file and create an indexed altitude bitmap file, then when you are done creating and finalizing your masterpiece: compile those two (2) bitmaps from the same folder to create a playable game world for your custom Ultima Online emulation servers or uoAvocation's game engine (uoAvos)!

<img src="http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png" width="24" height="24">**Color Table Editor**
- Create new, or modify the Adobeâ„¢ Photoshop Swatch (.ACO), Optimized Color (.ACT) files right from inside MapCreator! With this program you can manipulate all color aspects of MapCreator and how the compiler will read those colors.

- If Adobeâ„¢ Photoshop is too expensive, you can also use GIMP to create your worlds using our Drawing Tool section! This section will provide screenshots of our custom Adobeâ„¢ Photoshop color swatch (.ACO) and optimized color (.ACT) files.

<img src="http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png" width="24" height="24">**Facet Tutorials!**
- Forget the guess work of making maps! Tutorials will be added to assist you on your journey!! The tutorial section will include tutorials on the best techniques to create and modify Ultima Onlineâ„¢ worlds and is a work-in-progress and will be added to over time. The success of this depends on the community and user submissions by people like you!

<img src="http://www.uoavocation.net/portal/site_image/github/checkmark.png" width="24" height="24">**User Plugins Added!**
- Create or modify tile transitions, create or modify terrain types, view your flat bitmaps as spinning planets you can manipulate, and finally convert those pesky .mul files into .bmp, .uop, and back into .mul again! The user plugin section is a work-in-progress and will be added to over time. The success of this depends on the community and user submissions by people like you!
